Welcome to npp-installer! The automated notepad++ installer for linux. 

This application is easy to use, and should require little effort to use properly. 

Your linux system needs to have apt-get and wget to work. It has currently been tested on Ubuntu 7.04 and Debian 4.0 (but not the latest fix)

There is an issue with debain: the program installed npp in /home/root/.wine instead of /home/USERNAME/.wine. I have added a fix, but I have not tested it.
